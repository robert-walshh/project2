# ThermoTilt
#### Student Name: *Robert Walsh*   Student ID: *20102479*

I propose a project that involves creating a small device equipped with a temperature sensor and a tilt sensor. The purpose of this device is to monitor potential faults in industrial equipment, such as gensets, within an industrial environment. Specifically, in the case of industrial gensets, there is a wire that is soldered in the middle. If this wire is subjected to high temperatures, such as from a fire or intense heat source, it can snap.

The concept behind this device is to attach it to the wire. Once the wire snaps, the tilt sensor will be triggered, alerting the engineers. They can then check the device dashboard, which will display the current temperature. This immediate information will allow them to determine if the temperature is a cause for concern or if it's a false alarm.
