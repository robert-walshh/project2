# ThermoTilt


## An Arduino Device that can alert the user when the device gets moved or tilted which also keeps track of the current room temperature.

This project was built as part of the Internet of Things module in SETU as part of Project Semester 2. 

The project contains

* Code for the Arduino itself.
* A Schematic to set up the device.
* Video Demonstration
* Photos of the device throughout development

When the tilt sensor is activated a yellow LED lights up and a Webhook is sent to IFTTT. From there IFTTT sends an alert via Telegram to the user. Temperture Data is available via the Arduino IoT Cloud Dashboard.
