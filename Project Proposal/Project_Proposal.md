I propose a project that is a small temperature and climate tracking device. The device will be able to take in room temperature and outdoor temperature and preform basic calculations based on that data. For example: average temperature, difference between outdoor and indoor temperature, graph temperatures etc. These calculations will be viewable via an online dashboard.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

* Arduino MKR1000
* LCD Screen
* RGB LED
* Temperature Sensor
* C/C++
